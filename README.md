# Currency-Converter
The Currency Converter project is a tool that allows users to convert values from one currency to another. It utilizes real-time exchange rates and provides users with the most up-to-date conversion rates. The user simply selects the currency they want to convert from and to, enters the amount, and the tool does the rest.
